"""
Bitcoin is a form of digital currency, otherwise known as cryptocurrency. Rather than rely on a central authority like a bank, Bitcoin instead relies on 
a distributed network, otherwise known as a blockchain, to record transactions.

Because there’s demand for Bitcoin (i.e., users want it), users are willing to buy it, as by exchanging one currency (e.g., USD) for Bitcoin.

In a file called bitcoin.py, implement a program that:

Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, 𝑛, that they would like to buy. 
If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.

Queries the API for the CoinCap Bitcoin Price Index at rest.coincap.io/v3/assets/bitcoin?apiKey=YourApiKey. 
You should replace YourApiKey with the actual API key you obtained from your CoinCap account dashboard, which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys 
is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions, as with code like:

import requests

try:
    ...
except requests.RequestException:
    ...
    
Outputs the current cost of 𝑛 Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.
